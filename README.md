# Gnn_onHIV
Its highly recommended to use GPU to run this code.
You will need rdkit to run this code.
You will need mlflow to run this code.
I splited the train and test dataset manually. What you need is to pass in is a root directory (call it data), that is where the dataset should be stored. And we have two folders in data: 1-raw, 2-images. In raw you need to put the regular data(HIV_train, HIV_train_oversampled, HIV_test).
